## Guidance for Electric Vehicle (EV) Battery Health Prediction on AWS

### Introduction

EV batteries, predominately lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, have been the bottleneck for scaling EVs, which are crucial to a net-zero economy. One challenge in the EV battery ecosystem is insufficient and inaccurate battery state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) monitoring and prediction, resulting in shortened battery lifespan, driver frustration, lack of visibility for end-of-life processing, and wasted critical materials. Instead of the conventional static formula-based approach, this Guidance showcases how customers can use the AI/ML capabilities on AWS to easily predict SOH and RUL. Predictions of battery health will help OEMs and EV owners proactively plan for battery replacement, and most importantly, can be used to move battery into a new life and promote the overall circular economy of a battery. Moreover, integrating fault detection algorithms into EV battery management systems in collaboration with [Eatron Technologies](https://eatron.com/), enhances overall system resilience and contributes to the seamless operation of electric vehicles, thus advancing the sustainability goals of the automotive industry.

The sample code in this project is based on the [Guidance for Electric Vehicle Battery Health Prediction on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/electric-vehicle-battery-health-prediction-on-aws/). It deploys an event-driven ML pipeline for EV Battery health prediction using purpose-built services such as [Amazon Forecast](https://aws.amazon.com/forecast/). To simulate the data ingestion and consumption portions of the [Connected Mobility Platform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/architecture-diagrams/latest/connected-mobility-platform-on-aws/connected-mobility-platform-on-aws.html), we build a web application, which allows you to upload battery health data and visualize battery health prediction results.


### Architecture

Here is the reference architecture for this project:

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Node and NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 14 installed
* [AWS Cloud Developer Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html) installed and configured
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.8


### Deploying the CDK stack

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-electric-vehicle-battery-health-prediction-on-aws
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd source
    ```
3. Configure your AWS CLI to point to the AWS account and region where you want to deploy the solution. You can run the following command to verify which AWS account you are currently logged on:
    ```
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```
4. If you are using CDK to deploy to your AWS account for the first time, you will have to bootstrap your account. To do this, run the command:
    ```
    cdk bootstrap <account-number>/<region>
    ```
5. To build the entire project, run
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
6. To deploy the project, run
    ```
    npm run deploy
    ```
7. We have architected this demo in a way that self-registration is disabled and only administrators can add users to access the web application. Therefore, once the project is deployed, you need to create a Cognito User to access the web application [through the AWS Management console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-user-accounts.html) or [using AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-idp/admin-create-user.html).

8. You have finished deployment and setting up! You can find the URL of the web application in CloudFront, or as part of the CDK outputs (value for WebAppCloudFrontDistributionDomainName).

**Note**: Since WAF CloudFront ACL can only be installed in us-east-1, the WAF stack and App stack might be deployed to 2 separate regions, depending on what your default deployment region is.

### How it works

The sample code deploys a web application for 2 types of users: Developer and Fleet Operator. Developer has access to all parts of the application, and Fleet Operator can only view the dashboard with battery location and digital twin of batteries after at least one ML pipeline is executed successfully. You can switch profile by clicking the User icon and then the Switch Profile button.

After logging in, Developer can upload battery health datasets as well as processing plugin scripts (scripts to clean up data). We provide a [sample battery dataset](./source/demo/raw_dataset.csv) and [sample processing plugin file](./source/demo/processing_plugin.py) for easy testing. The sample dataset is from [this project](https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204) by Severson et al. Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation. Nature Energy volume 4, pages 383–391 (2019).

![Upload](assets/upload.png)

After files are uploaded, the ML pipeline gets triggered to start. Developer will see the progress of the ML pipeline.

![ML pipeline](assets/pipeline.png)

When the ML pipeline finishes (this can take a few hours), both Developer and Fleet Operator will see a map with batteries.

![Map](assets/map.png)

You can click on a vehicle to view battery information. To demonstrate how a digital twin for a battery could look like, we inserted some dummy values for the battery attributes, specifed [here](./source/deploy/assets/).

![Battery](assets/battery.png)

In the Battery Health Prediction panel to the right, the line chart shows past and predicted battery state of health. You can enlarge this panel and click Play to watch actual data streaming as comparison to predicted data. State of Health, RUL, and model drift were all predicted or calculated using the ML pipeline deployed with the web application.

![Prediction](assets/prediction.png)

Developer can view results from selected ML pipeline. They can click the User icon, navigate to Pipelines, select the desired pipeline, and click Connected Vehicles, which takes them to the dashboard with battery locations. For Fleet Operators, the predicted data they see are from the most recent pipeline.

There is an analytics section to examine the sensor data in detail. You can reach here by clicking the See Analytics button next to the Battery ID. In this panel you can view battery and cell level data. The data is visualized in a line chart, and you can select the time range to view.

### Fault Detection

The Fault Detection API provides real-time and historical data analysis for detecting faults in vehicles. It offers insights into various parameters such as temperature, voltage, and current, enabling users to monitor the health of their vehicles. This API is provided by Eatron Technologies, and is integrated into the web application. To access the API see the [section](#obtaining-an-api-key-for-analytics-and-fault-detection-apis) below.

##### Real-Time Anomaly Detection​

Detecting off-nominal performance in an EV is challenging, because the expected performance of a single component is dependent on the overall system operation. Rule-based anomaly detection model identifies deviations from the normal behavior based on sensor readings exceeding pre-defined thresholds. ​ Anomalous behaviors are primarily ​ caused by Over Temperature, Over Current or ​ Over Voltage. ​When the Trigger Anomaly Models switch is on, anomaly detection processes run in the background.

##### Accelerated Degradation (aging)​

Cell level abnormal aging resulting in degraded capacity with respect to the rest of the cells in the pack. It exposes the risk of overcharging as well as reduced lifespan. The model behind the scene predicts the real-time cell voltage divergence much faster than conventional rule-based methods.​

##### Lithium Plating ​Prediction

Deposition of lithium ions on the anode graphite surface is forming metallic lithium and dendritic structures. ​It cccurs mostly by the fast charging in low temperatures.​

##### Thermal Runaway Prediction​

It is a dynamic process due to a self-sustaining increase in temperature of the battery pack and occurs due to various internal and external events such as electrode degradation, electrolyte decomposition, increased internal resistance, short circuits etc. The AI model processes daily data as batch to identify likelihood of Thermal Runaway happening within the next day for a given battery back.​

##### SEI Growth Detection

The term "SEI" stands for Solid Electrolyte Interphase, and it plays a crucial role in the performance and safety of lithium-ion batteries. The SEI layer forms on the surface of the lithium electrode when the battery is initially charged. It is a thin layer of solid electrolyte that acts as a barrier between the liquid electrolyte and the lithium electrode.

SEI growth refers to the gradual thickening or accumulation of this layer over time as the battery undergoes charging and discharging cycles. While some degree of SEI growth is inevitable, excessive growth can have negative consequences for battery performance, such as increased internal resistance, capacity loss, and reduced cycle life. Researchers aim to develop strategies to mitigate SEI growth and improve battery performance and longevity.

##### Imbalance Detection

Imbalance in lithium-ion batteries refers to the uneven distribution of charge or capacity among the individual cells or modules within a battery pack. This can occur due to several factors and can have significant implications for battery performance, safety, and lifespan.

![Imbalance](assets/imbalance.jpeg)

##### Internal Short Circuit Detection

An internal short circuit in lithium-ion batteries occurs when a direct electrical connection is established between the positive and negative electrodes within a cell, bypassing the normal circuit path through the external load. This results in a rapid discharge of the battery's stored energy, often accompanied by the generation of heat and potentially leading to thermal runaway and catastrophic failure.

### Obtaining an API Key for Analytics and Fault Detection APIs

Analytics and Fault detection services are provided by Eatron Technologies. An Eatron API Key is required for the fault detection algorithms to work, please contact [Eatron Technologies](mailto:info@eatron.com). The API key should be added to the environment variables of the web application. You can do this by updating the `EATRON_API_KEY` value in [environment.ts](source/web-app/src/environments/environment.ts)(for local) and [environment.prod.ts](source/web-app/src/environments/environment.prod.ts)(for deployment) file
